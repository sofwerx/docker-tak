    ports:
#      - 3334/tcp      # Unknown.
      - 8087:8087/udp # Standard UDP. UDP is required for multicast traffic. Enabled by default on port 8087.
      - 8087:8087/tcp # Standard TCP. This is the method of using TCP advocated by the Cursor-on-Target standard,
                      # called "open-squirt-close." The sender opens a new TCP connection for each CoT message,
                      # and closes it immediately after sending the message. This method of using TCP has 
                      # performance limitations and is appropriate only for clients that send infrequent messages.
      - 8088:8088/tcp # streamtcp: TCP connection where the client keeps the connection open and sends and receives
                      # data continuously.  This is preferable to standard TCP in many situations and should be
                      # used for all clients that support it, including ATAK.
      - 8089:8089/tcp # stdssl: A continuous TCP connection like the streamtcp protocol, but with TLS 1.2 encryption.
                      # "ssl" is a bit of a misnomer; TAK Server actually uses TLS, not SSL.
                      # This connection is disabled by default.
#      - 42097:42907/tcp # Unknown.
#      - 127.0.0.11:45591:45591/tcp # Unknown.
